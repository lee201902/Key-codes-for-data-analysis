Cryptosporidium spp. are major diarrhea-associated pathogens in humans and livestock. Among the known species, C. xiaoi, which causes ovine cryptosporidiosis, has previously been recognized as a genotype of the bovine-specific C. bovis due to their high sequence identity in the small subunit rRNA gene. However, the lack of genomic data has limited characterization of the genetic correlates of host differences between the two closely related species. We sequenced the genomes of two C. xiaoi isolates and performed comparative genomic analysis.

We used various bioinformatics software to analyze the genomic characteristics of Cryptosporidium xiaoi. The command lines for running software is detailed in the code file.
